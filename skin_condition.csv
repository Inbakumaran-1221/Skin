Basal Cell Carcinoma,The most common type of skin cancer.,"BCC often appears as a slightly transparent bump on sun-exposed skin, like the head or neck. It might also look like a flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion, or a bleeding/scabbing sore that heals and then returns. It grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.","Treatment is almost always surgical, including excision, Mohs surgery, or curettage and electrodesiccation. For superficial cases, topical creams like Imiquimod or Fluorouracil (5-FU) may be used.",This is a form of skin cancer. You must see a dermatologist immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
Darier_s Disease,"A rare, genetic skin disorder.","Also known as keratosis follicularis, it's characterized by persistent, wart-like blemishes on the skin. These blemishes can be yellowish, skin-colored, or brown, may be greasy or crusty, and can have a strong odor. It most commonly affects the chest, back, neck, and scalp.","There is no cure, but treatments aim to manage symptoms. Medicated moisturizers with lactic acid can help. A dermatologist may prescribe topical retinoids (like Tretinoin) or, in severe cases, oral retinoids (Acitretin or Isotretinoin).",See a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and to create a long-term management plan.
Epidermolysis Bullosa Pruriginosa,"A rare, inherited connective tissue disease characterized by intense itching and blistering.","This condition causes severe, chronic itching (pruritus) that leads to scratching, which in turn causes blistering and thick, scar-like skin nodules (prurigo). It's a subtype of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.","Treatment is difficult and focuses on symptom control. This includes high-potency topical steroids, antihistamines to reduce itching, and wound care for blisters.",This is a complex condition that requires management by a specialized dermatologist.
Hailey-Hailey Disease,"A rare, inherited blistering disorder.","Also called familial benign pemphigus, it causes painful rashes and blisters in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. The skin can become raw, cracked, and infected.","There is no cure. Treatment aims to prevent flare-ups and infections. Topical corticosteroids and antibiotics (topical or oral) are the primary treatments. Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections can help reduce sweating, which often triggers flare-ups.",A dermatologist's care is essential for managing this chronic condition.
Herpes Simplex,A common viral infection caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).,"It causes small, painful blisters or sores (""cold sores"" or ""fever blisters"") that typically appear on or around the mouth (HSV-1) or genitals (HSV-2). The virus is contagious and stays in the body for life, with outbreaks recurring periodically.","While there's no cure, prescription oral antiviral medications like Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, and Famciclovir are highly effective at shortening outbreak duration and reducing severity.",See a doctor or dermatologist for a confirmed diagnosis and to get a prescription for antiviral treatment.
Impetigo,A common and highly contagious bacterial skin infection.,"Most common in young children, impetigo presents as red sores that can burst, ooze fluid, and develop a yellowish-brown, honey-colored crust. It typically appears around the nose and mouth.","It's treated with topical antibiotics like Mupirocin ointment. For more widespread infections, oral antibiotics (like Amoxicillin or Cephalexin) are prescribed.",Consult a doctor to get the right antibiotic treatment and prevent it from spreading to others.
Larva Migrans,A parasitic skin infection caused by hookworm larvae.,"Known as cutaneous larva migrans or ""creeping eruption,"" it occurs when larvae from the feces of infected animals (like dogs and cats) penetrate human skin. It creates intensely itchy, raised, winding red tracks on the skin where the larva has burrowed.",The infection is typically treated with oral anti-parasitic drugs like Albendazole or Ivermectin. Topical anti-parasitic creams may also be used.,See a doctor or dermatologist for diagnosis and prescription medication.
Leprosy Borderline,"The most common form of leprosy, sitting on the spectrum between Tuberculoid and Lepromatous leprosy.","This form is unstable, showing features of both ends of the leprosy spectrum. Lesions are more numerous than in Tuberculoid leprosy and can vary in size and shape. Patients are prone to inflammatory episodes called 'reactions,' which can cause acute nerve damage.","Treatment is with Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT), typically a 12-month course of Rifampicin, Dapsone, and Clofazimine. Steroids are often required to manage reactions.",Requires immediate and close monitoring by a specialist to manage the disease and prevent permanent disability.
Leprosy Lepromatous,"A severe, multibacillary (high-bacteria) form of leprosy resulting from a poor cell-mediated immune response.","This form involves widespread, symmetrical skin lesions, nodules, plaques, and thickening of the skin. It can affect the face, causing a ""leonine"" (lion-like) appearance. Nerve damage is widespread but develops more slowly than in other forms.","Requires an intensive Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) course, typically for 12 months or longer, using Rifampicin, Dapsone, and Clofazimine.","Immediate consultation with a doctor or infectious disease specialist is crucial to prevent severe, irreversible complications."
Leprosy Tuberculoid,A paucibacillary (low-bacteria) form of leprosy characterized by a strong cell-mediated immune response.,"This form typically presents with one or a few well-defined, numb, hairless skin patches. Nerve involvement happens early and can be severe but is usually limited to one or two nerves near the skin patch. It is less contagious than other forms.","Curable with a 6-month course of Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT), usually with Rifampicin and Dapsone.",Consult a specialist. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to preventing permanent nerve damage.
Lichen Planus,"An inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes.","On the skin, it appears as purplish, itchy, flat-topped bumps. In the mouth, it can form lacy white patches. The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to an autoimmune response.","For mild cases, it may resolve on its own. For persistent or severe cases, topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment. Antihistamines can help with itching.","See a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as it can be a long-lasting condition."
Lupus Erythematosus Chronicus Discoides,The most common type of chronic cutaneous (skin) lupus.,"An autoimmune disease that causes inflamed, scaly, coin-shaped sores and lesions, typically on areas exposed to the sun like the scalp, face, and ears. These lesions can cause permanent scarring and hair loss.","Treatment includes potent topical or injected corticosteroids, sun protection, and sometimes antimalarial drugs like Hydroxychloroquine.",This condition requires management by a dermatologist or rheumatologist to control symptoms and prevent scarring.
Melanoma,The most serious and aggressive type of skin cancer.,"Melanoma develops in the cells that produce melanin (pigment). It often resembles a mole, and some develop from existing moles. The ABCDEs are a guide for warning signs: Asymmetry, irregular Border, uneven Color, Diameter larger than 6mm, and Evolving or changing.","Treatment depends on the stage but almost always begins with wide surgical excision. For advanced melanoma, treatments may include immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy.","This is a potential medical emergency. If you suspect melanoma, see a dermatologist immediately. Early detection is critical and can be lifesaving."
Molluscum Contagiosum,A common and contagious viral skin infection.,"It causes small, raised, round, flesh-colored bumps on the skin. The bumps often have a tiny dimple or dot in the center. It's very common in children and spreads easily through direct contact or contaminated objects.","It usually resolves on its own within 6-12 months. However, a dermatologist can remove the bumps to prevent spread through cryotherapy (freezing), curettage (scraping), or by prescribing topical creams (like retinoids or Cantharidin).","See a dermatologist if the bumps are widespread, bothersome, or located on the face or genitals."
Mycosis Fungoides,"The most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the immune system).","It's a ""skin cancer"" that isn't from skin cells, but from immune cells that travel to the skin. It progresses slowly and can look like common skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis for years, appearing as red, scaly patches or thicker plaques.","Treatment is skin-directed in early stages and includes topical steroids, phototherapy (light therapy), and topical chemotherapy.",This condition is often misdiagnosed. A definitive diagnosis requires a skin biopsy. Consult a dermatologist if you have a persistent rash that doesn't respond to standard treatments.
Neurofibromatosis,A genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue.,"There are three types, with NF1 being the most common. Symptoms include flat, light brown spots on the skin (caf√©-au-lait spots), soft bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas), and freckling in the armpits or groin area.",There is no cure. Treatment focuses on monitoring tumor growth and managing complications. Surgery can remove painful or disfiguring neurofibromas. The medication Selumetinib is approved to treat certain tumors in children.,"Requires lifelong monitoring by a team of specialists, including a neurologist and dermatologist."
Papilomatosis Confluentes And Reticulate,A rare skin condition of unknown cause.,"Also known as Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, it presents as small, wart-like papules that merge together (confluent) in the center and form a net-like (reticulate) pattern at the edges. It typically appears on the upper chest, back, and neck.","It responds well to oral antibiotics, particularly Minocycline, even though it's not believed to be a bacterial infection. Topical retinoids can also be effective.","See a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment, as it can be mistaken for a fungal infection."
Pediculosis Capitis,An infestation of the hair and scalp by the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis).,"The main symptom is intense itching of the scalp. The lice are tiny insects, and their eggs (nits) look like tiny white or yellow dots attached to the hair shafts. It's very common in schoolchildren and spreads through head-to-head contact.",Over-the-counter shampoos and lotions containing Permethrin or Pyrethrins are the first-line treatment. Prescription medications like Ivermectin lotion are also available. Combing the wet hair with a fine-toothed nit comb is essential.,Can typically be managed with over-the-counter products. Consult a doctor if treatments fail.
Pityriasis Rosea,"A common, harmless skin rash.","It typically begins with a single, large oval pink patch called a ""herald patch."" A week or two later, smaller patches appear on the chest, back, and abdomen, often in a pattern that resembles a Christmas tree. The cause is thought to be a viral infection.","The rash usually goes away on its own in 6-8 weeks. Treatment is not necessary but focuses on relieving the itch with moisturizers, topical steroids, or antihistamines.",See a doctor or dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.
Porokeratosis Actinic,"A precancerous skin condition, specifically Disseminated Superficial Actinic Porokeratosis (DSAP).","DSAP appears as multiple small, dry, scaly, reddish-brown patches with a distinct raised thread-like border. It occurs on sun-exposed areas, like the arms and legs, and is more common in fair-skinned individuals. A small percentage of lesions can develop into skin cancer.","Treatment aims to reduce the risk of cancer and improve appearance. Options include cryotherapy, topical 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Imiquimod, or topical retinoids. Sun protection is crucial.",Essential to see a dermatologist for diagnosis and to monitor the lesions for any cancerous changes.
Psoriasis,A chronic autoimmune disease that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells.,"This buildup of cells causes scaling on the skin's surface. The most common type, plaque psoriasis, appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery-white buildup of dead skin cells. These patches are often itchy and can be painful.","Treatment depends on severity. Mild cases are treated with topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and moisturizers. Moderate to severe cases may require phototherapy (light therapy) or systemic medications (oral or injectable drugs like Methotrexate or biologics).",A dermatologist can provide an accurate diagnosis and create a treatment plan to manage this long-term condition.
Tinea Corporis,"A common fungal skin infection, also known as ringworm of the body.","Despite its name, it's not caused by a worm. It's a type of tinea fungus that causes a red, itchy, circular rash with a clearer center, resembling a ring. It can appear anywhere on the body.","It's effectively treated with over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as those containing Clotrimazole or Terbinafine. For extensive or resistant infections, a doctor may prescribe oral antifungal pills.","Can often be managed at home, but see a doctor if it doesn't improve with OTC treatment or is very widespread."
Tinea Nigra,A superficial fungal infection of the skin.,"It causes painless, brown to black, flat patches, most commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. It looks like a stain and is often mistaken for melanoma because of its dark color.",Responds very well to treatment with topical antifungal medications. Whitfield's ointment or salicylic acid can also help remove the stained skin layers.,It's important to see a dermatologist for a diagnosis to definitively rule out melanoma.
Tungiasis,A skin infestation caused by the female jigger flea (Tunga penetrans).,"The flea burrows into the skin, typically on the feet. It grows in size as it develops eggs, causing an intensely painful and itchy nodule with a central black dot (the rear end of the flea). It can lead to severe inflammation and secondary bacterial infections.",Treatment involves the surgical extraction of the embedded flea under sterile conditions by a healthcare professional. Applying topical medications can help kill the flea before removal. Tetanus vaccination is important.,Do not attempt to remove the flea yourself. See a doctor or visit a clinic for safe removal and to prevent infection.
actinic keratosis,A very common precancerous skin growth caused by long-term sun exposure.,"AKs are rough, scaly patches on the skin. They are often felt before they are seen and feel like sandpaper. They commonly appear on the face, lips, ears, scalp, and hands. If left untreated, they can progress to squamous cell carcinoma.","Treatment is necessary to prevent cancer development. Common treatments include cryotherapy (freezing), topical creams (5-Fluorouracil, Imiquimod), photodynamic therapy, or chemical peels.",Anyone with AKs should be under the regular care of a dermatologist.
dermatofibroma,"A common, benign (non-cancerous) skin growth.","It is a firm, small bump or nodule that is often found on the lower legs. They can be pink, brown, or tan. A key diagnostic feature is the ""dimple sign"": if you pinch it, it tends to dimple inwards. They may arise after a minor injury like an insect bite.","No treatment is necessary as they are harmless. They can be surgically removed if they are bothersome, painful, or for cosmetic reasons.","See a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish it from other, more serious growths."
nevus,"The medical term for a mole, a common, benign (non-cancerous) growth of pigment cells.","Moles are extremely common and can be flat or raised, and range in color from pink to dark brown or black. Most moles are harmless. However, it's crucial to monitor them for any changes in size, shape, color, or texture, as this could be a sign of melanoma.",No treatment is needed for benign moles. A dermatologist may remove a mole if it's bothersome or if it looks suspicious.,"Perform regular self-checks of your skin. See a dermatologist annually for a professional skin check, or immediately if you notice any changing mole."
pigmented benign keratosis,"A harmless, non-cancerous skin growth that is notable for its dark pigmentation.",This is a benign growth that appears as a well-defined colored lesion on the skin  ranging from tan to black The surface can be waxy or rough. (Note: This is just another name for Seborrheic Keratosis).,"No treatment is required. For cosmetic reasons, it can be removed by a dermatologist via cryotherapy (freezing) or curettage (scraping).","See a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis, as its dark color can sometimes mimic melanoma."
seborrheic keratosis,A very common non-cancerous skin growth often called the barnacles of aging.," These growths often have a waxy scaly slightly raised appearance. They can look as if they've been """"pasted"""" or """"stuck"""" onto the skin and are typically brown black  or tan. (Note: This is the same condition as Pigmented Benign Keratosis).""",Harmless and does not require treatment A dermatologist can remove it for cosmetic reasons using cryotherapy (freezing) or curettage (scraping)., It's wise to have a dermatologist confirm the diagnosis to distinguish it from skin cancer.
squamous cell carcinoma,The second most common type of skin cancer.,"SCC often appears as a persistent, thick, rough, scaly patch that can crust or bleed. It can also look like a firm, red nodule or a sore that doesn't heal. It usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of the body. While less aggressive than melanoma, it can spread if left untreated.","Treatment is typically surgical removal, either through excision or Mohs surgery. Radiation therapy may be used in some cases.",This is a form of skin cancer. You must see a dermatologist immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
vascular lesion,"A broad term for a benign abnormality of blood vessels, often appearing as a red or purplish mark on the skin.","This category includes many different types of growths. Common examples are ""cherry angiomas"" (small, bright red bumps common in adults), ""spider angiomas"" (a central red spot with radiating vessels), and port-wine stains (a type of birthmark). They are typically harmless.","Treatment is not medically necessary. For cosmetic removal, laser therapy is the most effective method.","See a dermatologist to get a specific diagnosis for the type of vascular lesion and to rule out any rare, more serious conditions."
